## Introduction
As technology evolves, ensuring the security of mobile applications becomes a critical concern. This repository serves as a comprehensive report on the Mobile Security Framework (MobSF), an open-source tool designed to assess the security posture of Android and iOS applications

## Static Analysis
One of the key features of MobSF is its ability to conduct static analysis on mobile applications. This section of the report provides an in-depth understanding of how MobSF scrutinizes the application without executing it. Topics covered include the analysis of source code, manifest files, and other static components that contribute to the overall security posture.

## Dynamic Analysis
MobSF's dynamic analysis capabilities are explored in this section, shedding light on how the framework assesses an application's behavior during runtime. Dynamic analysis is crucial for understanding how an application interacts with its environment, detecting potential security risks, and evaluating its resilience against various attack vectors.

## Findings and Recommendations
The culmination of the report presents the findings derived from the analysis performed on mobile applications using MobSF. It includes a summary of identified vulnerabilities, potential risks, and areas for improvement. Recommendations are provided to guide developers and security practitioners in enhancing the security of their mobile applications.
